The version of InterProScan you are using is 5.24-63.0
The version of the lookup service you are using is 5.27-66.0
As the data in these versions is not the same, you cannot use this match lookup service.
InterProScan will now run locally
If you would like to use the match lookup service, you have the following options:
i) Download the newest version of InterProScan5 from our FTP site by following the instructions on:
   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/interproscan.html
ii) Download the match lookup service for your version of InterProScan from our FTP site and install it locally.
    You will then need to edit the following property in your configuration file to point to your local installation:
    precalculated.match.lookup.service.url=

In the meantime, the analysis will continue to run locally.
